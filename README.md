## Problem Description
Our data set is related to the car accidents in Cincinnati from 2013 to 2020 and we were able to obtain this data on kaggle. The fields of the data set describe the time and date of the crash, type of accident, gender, injuries, conditions of the road, and context of the situation, along with other attributes. With the dimensions available we can analyze the correlation between many different dimensions and their correlation to crash statistics.
