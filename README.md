## Problem Description
Our data set is related to the car accidents in Cincinnati from 2013 to 2020 and we were able to obtain this data on kaggle. The fields of the data set describe the time and date of the crash, type of accident, gender, injuries, conditions of the road, and context of the situation, along with other attributes. With the dimensions available we can analyze the correlation between many different dimensions and their correlation to crash statistics.

How many car accidents were reported in Cincinnati from 2013 to 2020 for each gender and age?

The data set assisted us in visualizing the answer by creating a bar chart and line graph. In the bar chart, we separated gender into two different charts with the same scale making them easy to compare. Each bar represents a different age group. In the line chart, we broke down the genders and added in a prediction of accidents in the future. The answer to this question could help an insurance company in Cincinnati decide on the cost of a plan for a young male or an older female driver.

How many crashes occur by zip code in Cincinnati?

The second question answered using the data set was how many crashes occur by zip code in Cincinnati. We used the generated longitude and latitude to create a mapping of the Cincinnati area, along with providing the detail of the count of crashes. In doing this we were able to create a heat map of the crashes by zip code. This game is a great visualization of the density of crashes in Cincinnati. Looking at the map, we can see the higher density areas of Cincinnati due to the amount of crashes (The darker areas are the more populated parts of the city). From the bar graph we can see that 45202 is the zipcode with the highest number of crashes. Doing further research our team has discovered that 45202 zip code is the downtown part of Cincinnati which makes sense when looking at the heat map of the number of crashes.
